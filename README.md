# Development version
The development version is the latest (and therefore potentially unstable) version version. If you use this version you
should expect to encounter bugs.

The development version can be downloaded from
https://projects.alexchesters.com/c182rg-improvement-project/latest/c182rg-improvement-project.zip

# Latest version
The latest version can be downloaded by visiting
https://github.com/AlexChesters/c182rg-improvement-project/releases/latest, this page contains the latest release and
the release body will contain a link to that version's `c182rg-improvement-project.zip` file.

# Installation
Regardless of which version you install the installation process is the same, just copy the `c182rg-improvement-project`
from _inside_ the zip file you downloaded (not the unzipped folder itself) to your MSFS Community folder.

If you want to be sure you are copying the correct folder, ensure the folder you are copying has a `manifest.json`
_directly_ inside it, e.g.:
```bash
c182rg-improvement-project/
    manifest.json
    layout.json
    # other files
```
