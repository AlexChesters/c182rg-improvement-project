# Installation
Regardless of which version you install the installation process is the same, just copy the `c182rg-improvement-project`
from _inside_ the zip file you downloaded (not the unzipped folder itself) to your MSFS Community folder.

If you want to be sure you are copying the correct folder, ensure the folder you are copying has a `manifest.json`
_directly_ inside it, e.g.:
```bash
c182rg-improvement-project/
    manifest.json
    layout.json
    # other files
```
